# CLI Suggestion

It's just a simple module to return a command suggestion based on a try.

## Installation

Add to your project:

`npm install cli-suggestion --save`

## Starting

Require and start with options:

```js
var suggestion = require('suggestion');

...

var doSuggestion = suggestion({
    command: '',
    file: 'suggestions.json',
    text: 'Did want to say that?'
});
```

Then you can receive suggestions passing a string as the attempt:

```js
var return = doSuggestion('test'); // Just the string, do not pass your app/command.
```

## Options

### command | `default: a empty string`

String | Your command. To be added before suggestion:

> Did want to say that?
>   command suggestion

### file | `default: suggestions.json`

String | The suggestions JSON file.
If it's invalid we will consider no suggestions.

### text | `default: Did want to say that?`

String | A humman readable text before suggestion.
Just like GIT.

## Suggestion File

It's a JSON file with a array of suggestions.
Each suggestion should have `command` (string) and `errors` (array of strings) properties.

```json
[
  {
    "command": "--test",
    "errors": ["test", "t"]
  },
  {
    "command": "--version",
    "errors": ["version", "v"]
  },
]
```
